# Movie-Recommendation-System

This project is collaborated by Chu-Yun Hsiao, Chia-Yen Ho, Shu-Yun Liu, Yu-Chun Peng.

As movie streaming platforms being prosperous for the past decade, the recommendation engine behind each platform has become even more important in order to retain users by providing more precise movie recommendations. The recommendation engine can be broadly applied in various aspects of our everyday life, such as Media, E-Commerce, Retail ,etc. 

As passionate data scientists who love watching movies in our leisure time, we decided to explore how these streaming platforms recommend movies based on our behavior on the platform. We create four movie recommendation systems via **Demographic Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Collaborative Filtering, and Hybrid techniques**, each of which provides movie recommendation based on user preferences or movie features. Since most of the files are too big, We stored all the data on google drive. If you are interested, feel free to access the raw data and python files with this link.
